			<h2>Level 1-?</h>
			<p>
				Tiles will be shown that contain letters, numbers, or, pictures.
				After a few seconds the tiles will flip over and the level timer 
				will start to count down. The objective is to match all the tiles
				before the timer runs out. When tiles are matched they disappear
				(go "Pang).
			<p/>
			<p>
				To match tiles simply press two like tiles one after another. 
				Successfully matching tiles will add points to your level score,
				which gets added to your total score at the end of the level. If 
				you get a match wrong you will lose points. The level ends and your
				points are totalled if the timer runs our or you run out of points.
			</p>
			<h2>Level ?-end</h2>
			<p>
				After level ? characters from the Korean and Mandarin languages 
				will start to appear. Before the level starts you will be shown
				the Korean or Mandarin tile (along with phonetic spelling) along
				with the corresponding English Tile. Matching works the same as
				in previous levels.
